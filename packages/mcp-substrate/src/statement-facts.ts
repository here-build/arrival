// Benefits:
// - Correct handling of vectors, characters, datum comments, etc.

// - Cycle-safe walking for R7RS datum labels.

 *      flat alternating name/value, names at the even indices.

 *  top of the slot (whole-list) or wrapped in its own pair-sublist (per-element), so the first
 *  element's shape — atomish vs. structural — is a total discriminator. Testing every element
 *  (names AND values) was the old spike-parser-era bug this module inherited and fixed: a single
 *  compound VALUE (`[a 1 b (+ 1 2)]` — a call, a `(lambda …)`, a nested `(let …)`; the everyday
 *  Clojure idiom of computing a binding from a prior one) must never mis-route the whole slot to

 *  binding's own VALUE (e.g. `(letrec ((f (lambda (n) n))) (f))`'s `n`), and is also what
 *  reproduces the old regex's over-inclusive match on a trigger word used purely as quoted DATA
 *  (never specifically excluded, matching "like-for-like").
 *
 *  `seen` is `walk`'s OWN cross-call cycle guard (module header): a structural node is marked the
 *  first time `walk` itself descends into it, and a re-encountered node (only possible via a
 *  genuinely circular/shared datum-label structure — real, non-shared parses never repeat a node
 *  identity) short-circuits rather than re-descending. This is safe even for a legitimately

 *  {@link defineShapeOf}'s job, a separate mechanism (matching `topLevelDefineName`'s current,
 *  separate treatment from `scanLocalBindings`). A function-form nested define's OWN parameter
 *  list (e.g. `(define (g x) ...)` nested inside a let body) is NOT walked as params here either
 *  — only its name is captured — reproducing scope-scan.ts's existing behavior exactly (only an
