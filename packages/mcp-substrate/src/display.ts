// display.ts — the `display` affordance, HOST-SIDE ONLY.
//
// ─── WHY THIS IS HERE AND NOT IN ARRIVAL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Arrival has no `display`, and must not: ports and IO are omitted BY DESIGN. It is a pure
// inference plane, and an ambient write has no value-construction site for provenance — a value
// that gets "printed" has no derivation the trace can slice. That law is not bending, and this
// file does not bend it. Nothing here writes anywhere; `display` returns its argument.
//
// ─── WHY IT EXISTS ANYWAY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A model writes `(display x)` constantly. It is the natural Scheme spelling of "show me this" —
// a reflex, not a request for IO. In the 89-task corpus it cost a hard door and a wasted round on
// 32% OF TASKS, and the model would then try `(display …)` again, or fall back to bare `x`, or —
// in the trajectory that made this measurable — burn its rounds and quit.
//
// The door was correct and useless. It refused the SPELLING while the INTENT was perfectly
// serviceable: the model wants the value. So the HOST offers the verb, and the language stays pure.
// That is the whole shape of this codebase's design — take materialization away from the caller,
// keep only their intent.
//
// ─── THE SEMANTICS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   TOP-LEVEL  `(display X)`      → PASS-THROUGH. The wrap is stripped from the AST before eval, so
//                                   the statement simply evaluates X and its value IS the result.
//                                   Nothing extra is rendered: the model asked to see X, and X is
//                                   the answer. A `#| … |#` echo beside it would be noise.
//
//   NESTED     `(f (display X))`  → IDENTITY + SIDE EFFECT. `display` returns X untouched, so
//                                   composition is unaffected, and records what it saw. The runner
//                                   renders it after the statement's own result:
//
//                                       #| (display (list 1 2 3)):  (1 2 3) |#
//
//                                   ...carrying the ORIGINAL EXPRESSION, because "(1 2 3)" alone
//                                   does not tell the model WHICH display it came from when several
//                                   fire in one statement.
//
// The nested rewrite injects each call's own source text as a second argument — the evaluated value
// alone cannot recover it, and matching displays to values by walking the AST afterwards is UNSOUND:
// `(if c (display a) (display b))` has two display forms and exactly one firing, so any positional
// zip silently misattributes.
