// DoorSession verbosity gate — PER-SHAPE, not per-code (regression pin).
//
// The gate teaches a lesson VERBOSE on its first per-session occurrence, terse after (Rule 4).
// The key was `door.code` alone; but three codes are each emitted by SEVERAL DISTINCT lesson
// shapes (different trigger, different text, different teaching):
//   • envelope/unbound-in-expr  — explicit resolution / tie / server-menu / fuzzy / quote-literal
//   • envelope/scope-confusion  — cascade / cross-scope / repeated-local
//   • envelope/bare-tool-call   — plain (bare/tie) / global-collision (ambiguousBypassDoor)
// Keying on the code alone let the FIRST shape to fire consume the single verbose slot for EVERY
// other shape under that code — so a model's genuine FIRST encounter with, say, the server-menu
// lesson rendered TERSE merely because an unrelated explicit-resolution lesson had fired earlier,
// silently skipping teaching the model had never actually seen. FIXED by gating on
// `door.verbosityKey ?? door.code`: each distinct shape carries its own stable per-shape key, so
// distinct lessons no longer starve each other, while a code with a single shape (and a genuine
// REPEAT of the same shape) keeps the plain per-code collapse byte-for-byte. `code` stays the
// telemetry/routing key throughout — only the verbosity gradient got finer.
