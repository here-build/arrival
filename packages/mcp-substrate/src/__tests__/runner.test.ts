// Two invariants provable only through the REAL `createDoorsRunner(...).run(...)` loop
// (runner.ts) — the syntax gate, the forms/statements alignment logic, and real `exec()` —
// never at the `statement-facts.ts` unit level alone:
//
//   1. THE CRASH REGRESSION: ordinary R7RS code with a character literal (e.g.
//      `(char=? #\" (car chars))`) must return a normal, non-throwing result. A retired spike
//      parser used to run redundantly on the same source text, independently of the real
//      interpreter, and choke on `#\"`; the real interpreter has always handled it fine.
//   2. THE `#;` R7RS-CORRECTNESS CASE: `runner.ts` executes/analyzes exclusively from `forms`
//      (the real parser's output), never from `splitTopLevel`'s text-statement count — so a
//      `#;`-commented-out form must never execute. A text-based split leaves the `#;` marker
//      stripped from its slice but does NOT skip the datum that follows: `splitTopLevel`'s
//      `isSkippable` only recognizes the bare `#;` marker token, so the tokenizer still starts
//      a fresh text statement at the very next token. Executing text statements directly (as
//      opposed to `forms`, where `parse()` genuinely drops a `#;`-commented form) would run the
//      commented-out code for real. This test pins the forms-based behavior and guards against
//      regressing back to text-based execution.
