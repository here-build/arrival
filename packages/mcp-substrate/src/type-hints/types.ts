// This file is the executable spec the red suite (src/__red__/type-hints/) is written
// against, BEFORE the implementation exists. Module layout (pinned — the red suite
// imports these exact names): select.js exports `selectHints: SelectHints`; render.js
// exports `renderHint: RenderHint`; context-ring.js exports `createContextRing():
// ContextRing`; spine-lens.js exports `createSpineLens(env): TypeHintLens`. Everything here is spine-independent: the
// lens arrives through the `TypeHintLens` interface, implemented by a stub in tests and
// by the type-layer spine adapter (rework §8.1 consumer #2) once S2 lands. Implementers
// change this file only by amending the design doc first.
