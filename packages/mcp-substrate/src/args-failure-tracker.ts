// args-failure-tracker — escalation state for the localized args-misuse door

// SIBLING of `FutilityTracker` (futility.ts) — same injection pattern, same export/import
// discipline for session round-trips — but the INVERSE gradient: futility's `seen` set is
// monotonic verbose-once-then-terse (repetition earns LESS teaching); this tracker's counter
// is monotonic terse-then-verbose (repetition earns MORE teaching, up to the L3 anti-guess
// script). Mixing the two state machines would corrupt both contracts, hence a separate file
// (design doc §2.4's "NOT in DoorSession" decision) rather than a shared class.
//
// NOT unified with FutilityTracker (design doc's "Known limits", deliberately deferred):
// futility watches SUCCESSFUL non-progress, this watches FAILURES — different reset triggers.
