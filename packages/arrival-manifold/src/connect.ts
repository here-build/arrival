/** The slice of the SDK `Client` the manifold actually uses. The MCP SDK's `Client`
 *  satisfies this as-is; non-MCP upstreams (atlas-sandbox.ts) implement it directly
 *  instead of faking a JSON-RPC transport.
 *
 *  `request` is the tool-call path, NOT `callTool`: `callTool` performs the SDK's
 *  CLIENT-SIDE output-schema validation and THROWS on a mismatch — discarding the content
 *  blocks that already arrived (sdk/client/index.js: the result is received, the validator
 *  rejects, the payload is dropped). That makes any tool whose own output contradicts its own
 *  declared schema unusable through the manifold, for data sitting right there. We issue the
 *  request ourselves and adjudicate the mismatch ourselves (server.ts's `outputSchemaMismatch`):
 *  the schema is a CLAIM ABOUT the payload, not a licence to delete it. `callTool` stays in the
 *  Pick because tests and non-salvaging callers still use it. */
