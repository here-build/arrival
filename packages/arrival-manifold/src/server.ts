// server — wires the MCP SDK Server directly. Every connected upstream server's tools
// bind into ONE assembled ambient (bind.ts); the catalog (catalog.ts) becomes the
// single exposed tool; ListTools/CallTool hand off to that one tool (manifold-tool.ts).
// A CallTool for anything other than the manifold tool is a boundary DOOR (errors-as-
// doors): the server serves nothing else, and it says so as isError carrying the recovery.
//
// AUTO-PRESENT (docs/response-normalizer.md §3.5, V ruling 2026-07-13): a single-text-
// block response that isn't valid JSON is now ALSO tried against `detectEnvelope`'s strict
// recognizer family (ndjson/csv/tsv/toon/python-literal, plus prose-prefix/suffix
// stripping — §A2) — same class as the pre-existing grandfathered JSON.parse below,
// extended to the other strict formats; a refusal still falls back to the raw string
// exactly as before (`unwrapToolResult`'s NEVER-throw contract). The FIRST time a tool's
// response is auto-presented this way, its qualified name is latched by
// `ObservedSignatureTracker` (normalizer/observed-signature.ts) and the tool's catalog
// signature line gains an `[observed] <format> <shape>` annotation on the NEXT soft
// refresh — see `softRefresh`/`runWithSoftRefresh` below.
//
// BLOCK-LEVEL ENVELOPE ALGEBRA (second-foundation/arrival-bench/docs/benchmark-defect-register.md §A1) — an ARITY gate,
// not a SHAPE gate: a multi-TEXT-block response (cli-mcp-server's payload + invariant
// "\nCommand completed with return code: 0" trailer; pubmed's one-complete-JSON-object-
// per-block search results) is now ALSO classified by `detectBlockEnvelope`
// (normalizer/detect.ts) before falling back to the untouched block-array passthrough —
// exactly one structural block (with prose anywhere around it) becomes an envelope
// `{value, prefix?, suffix?}`; every block structural AND homogeneous in top-level kind
// becomes a vector of the parsed values; anything else (0 structural, or 2+ of mixed
// kind) stays raw. See `unwrapToolResult`'s doc comment below for the full rule set.
//
// tools/listChanged (H-2): rebuild-the-world. `buildManifoldEnv` composes ALL servers'
// tools onto one EnvCapability; there is no per-server layer to surgically rebind, so a
// toolset change is a full rebuild: re-list the notifying server, then rebuild ambient +
// scope + catalog + tool. This is cheap (the capability is symbol-only) and IMMUTABLE-SWAP safe:
//   • the rebuild constructs a brand-new ambient/scope/catalog/tool; the old ones are
//     never mutated;
//   • an in-flight eval holds the old tool closure (and its ambient/scope) and finishes
//     against the old world undisturbed;
//   • the swap is one reference assignment after the rebuild completes — a listChanged
//     becomes visible atomically BETWEEN evals, never within one. The superseded world's
//     ambient is disposed right after the swap (never before — an in-flight eval must
//     never see its own ambient torn down mid-flight).
// Ordering contract: a CallTool that dispatches before the swap sees the old world even
// if the notification has already arrived; after the swap, the new one. Multiple
// notifications serialize on a promise chain (no interleaved rebuilds; each rebuild re-
// reads the current tool map, so a coalesced older notification cannot clobber a newer
// build). DELIBERATE side effect: the fresh scope drops any `(define ...)`s accumulated by
// earlier evals — a toolset change is a world change, and stale session state referring
// to vanished tools is worse than a clean slate.
//
// SOFT REFRESH (auto-present signature amendment) is the OTHER, narrower kind of world
// update: it rebuilds ONLY the catalog string + the manifold tool's description, reusing
// the SAME ambient/scope/tools/bypassResolution/trace the live world already has — no
// upstream is re-listed, nothing is re-bound, and `(define ...)`s survive. It fires after
// a manifold-tool call completes (never mid-call, so a single program's multiple
// first-detections batch into one catalog rebuild), and only when at least one signature
// line actually changed (a purely-declared tool's response parsing is latched but never
// changes its already-declared `-> shape`, so it never triggers a notification).

 *    1. `isError: true` THROWS (text blocks' text as the message) — an upstream error
 *       becomes the standard `Error: <message>` observation.
 *    2. `structuredContent` present → it IS the typed value (outputSchema-declaring
 *       servers only).
 *    3. exactly ONE text block → the text, JSON-parsed when valid JSON (a block holding
 *       `3` composes as the number 3 — MCP has no other channel for a typed scalar
 *       from a plain server), else raw string. A server needing a literal string that
 *       happens to be valid JSON declares an outputSchema and sends structuredContent.
 *         - A3 (benchmark-defect-register.md §A3) — DOUBLE-ENCODED JSON STRING: when
 *           `JSON.parse` SUCCEEDS and yields a STRING (not object/array — a server that
 *           double-JSON-encodes, or a plain prose payload that happens to arrive
 *           JSON-string-quoted), that string is re-fed through `detectEnvelope` ONCE
 *           (never recursing further — depth-0 past this single re-dispatch, per §3's
 *           "narrow and non-recursive" re-dispatch law). A genuinely double-encoded
 *           structure (met-museum-shaped: the block's text IS a JSON string whose OWN
 *           content is itself valid JSON) surfaces as that structure; ordinary prose
 *           (met-museum's actual colon-KV `"Object ID: …\nTitle: …"` shape) is refused
 *           by `detectEnvelope` exactly like any other unrecognized text and stays the
 *           plain string — never silently coerced into something else.
 *         - AUTO-PRESENT (response-normalizer §3.5, V ruling 2026-07-13): when the text
 *           is NOT valid JSON, it is tried against `detectEnvelope` — A2
 *           (benchmark-defect-register.md §A2) widened this from the narrower
 *           `detectParse` (ndjson/csv/tsv/toon/python-literal, strict-or-refuse) to its
 *           strict superset, which ALSO strips a prose prefix/suffix around one embedded
 *           structure (desktop-commander get_config's `"Current configuration:\n{…}"`) —
 *           BEFORE falling back to the raw string. Only `.value.value` crosses; the
 *           envelope shell's own keys (`raw`/`prefix`/`suffix`) never enter the observed
 *           type (§4.2) — dropping the prose prefix here is a deliberate faithfulness
 *           trade AT THIS SINGLE-BLOCK SEAM (the block-level envelope below keeps
 *           `prefix`/`suffix` VISIBLE instead, because there the prose is already a
 *           separate block, not text sharing one block with the structure). Same
 *           never-throw contract either way. `onAutoPresent` fires (at most once per
 *           call, for any sub-case above) with the format tag and parsed value whenever
 *           this rule actually presents something other than the bare raw string — the
 *           caller's hook for the observed-signature latch (server.ts's `toBoundServer`).
 *    4. more than one TEXT block, ALL blocks text (no binary in play — rule 5's binary
 *       pre-pass stays untouched and runs after this, exactly as before) — A1
 *       (benchmark-defect-register.md §A1) BLOCK-LEVEL ENVELOPE ALGEBRA, an ARITY-gate
 *       fix: `detectBlockEnvelope` (normalizer/detect.ts) partitions the blocks'
 *       texts by `detectParse` success. MCP block boundaries are EXACT (the server
 *       handed us the cuts), so — unlike rule 3's single-string envelope — prose on
 *       BOTH sides of the one structural block is unambiguous, never refused:
 *         - exactly ONE structural block (any number of prose blocks around it, either
 *           side) → an envelope `{value, prefix?, suffix?}` (cli-mcp-server's
 *           payload-block + invariant `"\nCommand completed with return code: 0"`
 *           trailer-block shape).
 *         - EVERY block structural AND homogeneous in top-level kind (all object, or
 *           all array) → a vector of the parsed values (pubmed's JSONL-by-blocks: one
 *           complete JSON object per block, `content[]` genuinely IS a collection).
 *         - anything else (0 structural, or 2+ structural of MIXED kind) → falls
 *           through to rule 5/6 below, strict-or-refuse held exactly as at the string
 *           level.
 *    5. zero / non-text / unclassified-multi-text blocks → the untouched block array,
 *       EXCEPT (2026-07-05, attachments.ts): a BINARY block among them is never passed
 *       through raw. Its base64 payload is serialized REPL text; it is replaced by a
 *       compact `#<attachment N: mime/type, NNN bytes>` stub. A lone binary block
 *       collapses straight to that stub STRING (mirroring rule 3's single-value shape);
 *       a mix keeps every text block's own object, binary members swapped only. The
 *       original block is captured (via the `stub` callback, an `AttachmentCollector`)
 *       for the manifold tool's response to pass through as a separate content block. A
 *       call with no binary blocks takes the exact untouched path. */
