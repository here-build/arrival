// H-3 — the preamble honesty gate, as a CLAIM LEDGER.
//
// Each row is one claim the catalog preamble makes about the interpreter, carrying:
//   - `anchor`: the claim's identifying phrase in the preamble. This is the reason that exact
//     regex exists — delete the claim from the preamble and the anchor MUST fail, forcing the
//     row (and its behavioral evidence) to be reconsidered together. `anchor: null` marks
//     unclaimed-but-bound behavior we still pin: H-3 permits under-claiming; OVER-claiming is
//     the crash class (the model plans around a capability that isn't there and burns a whole
//     episode on it — the Clojure-brace bug). A claim this suite can't verify must be REMOVED
//     FROM THE PREAMBLE, not weakened here.
//   - `evals`: the claimed-available path — [expr, expected rendering] against the ACTUAL
//     assembled manifold env (buildManifoldEnv — the same assembly production uses).
//   - `forbidden`: the claimed-forbidden path — exprs that must error AND whose error must
//     NAME the forbidden head verb (an unbound OPERAND also says "Unbound variable" but names
//     the wrong symbol — the failure mode that produces a false pass on the set!-row otherwise).
//   - `contentBlocks`: claims about MESSAGE BOUNDARIES — [expr, exact content-block texts].
//     Needed because textOf joins blocks with \n, erasing exactly the boundary such a claim
//     is about (audit SEV-2).
//   - `coveredBy`: the claim's behavioral evidence lives in a SIBLING suite (this env binds
//     zero tools, so tool-facing claims can't walk here). Format: "file.test.ts — what proves
//     it" ("+"-joined for several files). The runner verifies every named file EXISTS in this
//     directory (a renamed/deleted sibling breaks the row loudly); whether the named test
//     still proves the claim stays a review-time judgment — the pointer is a signpost, not a
//     proof. Division of labor (suites reached by coveredBy pointers):
//       bind.test.ts — kwargs fold, keyword order, optional omission; real-outputSchema `->`
//       unwrap.test.ts (H-5) — JSON text parses, block-array pass-through, nested composition
//       server.test.ts — exactly ONE tool exposed; upstream outputSchema → catalog `->` suffix
//       session-declaration-persistence.test.ts — cross-call defines at the MCP boundary
//       repl-continue.test.ts — failed statement doesn't kill siblings; env keeps successes
//       timeout.test.ts (H-1) — the eval-budget error surface
//       doors.test.ts + error-contract.test.ts — envelope doors teach the recovery (H-4)
//     (attestation-flows.test.ts and tool-signature.test.ts also carry deferred evidence, but
//     are exercised by this file's own bespoke walks / structure tests, not coveredBy rows.)
//     Every row must carry evals, forbidden, contentBlocks, or coveredBy — an anchor-only row
//     with none of these is vacuous and the runner rejects it.
//
// Known limit (accepted): anchors are substring pins — a meaning-inverting edit around an
// anchor ("this is NO LONGER R7RS-small") still matches. The behavioral walks are the real
// gate; anchors only tie claims to their evidence.
