// The FUTILITY DOOR's MCP-WIRING half (futility.ts + doors.ts futile/duplicate generators +
// manifold-tool drain + DoorSession.renderNote), driven through a REAL manifold server + a fake
// upstream. Measured problem: a model retries a degraded upstream tool many times (a search tool
// returning the identical "no results / bot detection" body under varied queries), burning the
// turn budget with no answer. Shape-based, semantics-free detection tells it to stop: the door is
// an advisory line ("Note: ...") appended to the SUCCESSFUL call's output — the tool result
// itself flows through untouched. Two triggers: futile-retry (last 3 results identical despite
// ≥2 distinct arg sets) and duplicate-call (same tool + same args + same result twice in a row).
//
// The PURE shape-logic half (`FutilityTracker`/`normalizeResultText` exercised directly, no MCP
// transport) lives in `@inhuman.tools/mcp-substrate`'s own `futility.test.ts` — this file keeps
// only the wiring-through-a-real-server coverage.
//
// The futility Note is not its own standalone content block: every note-shaped producer
// (introduced-bindings, elision, futility, attachment) rides the consolidated
// `#| ── environment notes ── … |#` trailing block. The door text itself asserts degradation as a
// conditional fact ("the same result despite different arguments"), not a settled one, and
// prescribes no specific next action — see the `notes()` helper and the two TRIGGER-1 assertions
// below.
