// RESULT-RECORDER SIDE-EFFECT COUNT — a safety property, not a correctness one. The design
// breaks the A↔futility↔doors package cycle by passing the futility tracker's narrow
// `record(name, args, result)` closure from the binder (bind.ts's `rosettaDef`) to the runner
// (today: manifold-tool.ts's drain). The failure modes are COUNT-shaped:
//   • recorded ZERO times per invocation — the wire is silently dropped (a tool built without a
//     tracker never records, exactly like today's `tracker?.record(...)` optional-chained call —
//     futility detection silently dies without anyone noticing, since nothing THROWS).
//   • recorded TWICE per invocation — double-wired at both the membrane and some other site would
//     inflate the ring buffer 2x per real call, producing FALSE futility doors (a degraded-tool
//     verdict reached in 2 real calls instead of 3, or a duplicate-call verdict off calls that
//     were never actually identical in the model's own turn count).
//
// `futility.test.ts` already proves a `Note:` EVENTUALLY fires through the server after 2-3
// shaped calls — but that indirect assertion cannot distinguish "recorded once" from "recorded
// twice, deduplicated by the ring/hash logic before it would matter" (both produce the same
// observable Note on the same call, since FutilityTracker's own triggers are already idempotent
// against a duplicate hash). This file spies the recorder directly — the exact call-count
// property the design's binder→runner boundary must preserve.
