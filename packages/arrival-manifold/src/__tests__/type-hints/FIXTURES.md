# Type-hints spine fixtures — the acceptance contract

This is the human-readable twin of `spine-fixtures.test.ts` (Ring 3). Each row is one scheme
program run against a fixture `arrival-manifold` env, through the real spine
(`createSpineLens` → `selectHints` → `renderHint`), driven by the actual codes TS fires —
cross-checked against `@inhuman.tools/mcp-substrate`'s own
`src/__tests__/type-hints/json-schema-to-ts.test.ts` integration matrix.

`HINT_WHITELIST` covers three mistake classes: a wrong-typed keyword **value** localizes to
its property assignment (**2322**, not 2345); a keyword-name typo with a near-name candidate
shadows to a did-you-mean (**2561**); a keyword-name typo with no candidate fires **2353**.

| # | program | context | erroredStatementIndexes | expected code | expected render fragment | class |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `(fx/set_count :count "five")` | — | `[0]` (real runtime error) | `2322` | `expected`/`actual` populated; render mentions `(string->number` | wrong kwarg VALUE TYPE |
| 2 | `(fx/search :query "x" :max_result 5)` | — | `[0]` **by fiat** (see caveat below) | `2561` | `propertyName: "max_result"`, `candidateProperties` contains `"max_results"` | CLOSE-typo kwarg (did-you-mean shadows 2353) |
| 3 | `(fx/search :query "x" :zzzzz_unrelated 5)` | — | `[0]` **by fiat** | `2353` | `propertyName: "zzzzz_unrelated"`, no close candidate | FAR-typo kwarg (no did-you-mean) |
| 4 | `(define (add2 a b) (+ a b)) (add2 1)` | — | `[1]` (real runtime arity error; the `define` succeeds) | `2554` | — (arity subsumes the `Signature:` echo) | arity on a SCHEME-DEFINED lambda (never a tool call — tool calls lower to one kwargs object) |
| 5 | `(define (double x) (* x 2)) (fx/set_count :count (double 21))` | — | `[]` (both genuinely succeed) | n/a | n/a — `selectHints(...)` returns `[]` | precision floor / false-positive canary (polarity) |
| 6 | `(fx/set_count :count bad_count)` | `["(define bad_count \"not-a-number\")"]` | `[0]` (real runtime error — the context define's value is a string) | `2322`, `actual` = `"string"` (TS widens a `const`'s literal initializer at a later reference site) | mentions `(string->number` | CONTEXT-DEFINE CARRYOVER — proves the recipe (re-lowered context source) actually types `bad_count`, not just "some error fired": a broken/absent context wiring would instead surface an UNBOUND-name diagnostic (2304, off-whitelist → empty selection), not 2322/"string" |
| 7 | (sweep, not its own program) | — | — | — | every hint rendered by rows 1-3 and 6 avoids `Cons<`, `readonly`, `Promise<`, `/TS\d{4}/`, `undefined` | no raw TypeScript surfaces in a rendered hint |

## Fixture tools (bound via the real `buildManifoldEnv`, not a mock)

| qualified name | schema | invoke behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `fx/set_count` | `{ count: number }` (required) | throws if `typeof args.count !== "number"` |
| `fx/search` | `{ query: string }` required, `{ max_results?: number }` optional | throws if `typeof args.query !== "string"`; otherwise echoes `query` |

`fx/set_count` and `fx/search` self-validate their own inputs — a real upstream MCP tool that
receives a wrongly-typed argument either throws or returns `isError: true` (both surface as a
runtime `Error:` block per `manifold-tool.ts`'s frozen error contract), so the fixture's
runtime behavior matches production, not just its schema shape.

## Coverage boundaries

1. **Rows 2/3's activation-policy gap.** The kwargs-typo call does not itself runtime-error
   (arrival's kwargs runtime tolerantly drops the unknown key), so `erroredStatementIndexes:
   [0]` is supplied BY FIAT to isolate the spine's diagnostic *mechanics* from the separate,
   undecided *activation* question of whether production ever calls `selectHints` for an
   on-success statement. Ring 2's integration suite (`src/__tests__/type-hints/integration.test.ts`)
   owns that wiring question.
2. **Accessor misuse is out of scope.** `mcp-substrate`'s `json-schema-to-ts.ts`'s `toolArrowType` types every
   tool's RETURN as `unknown` for v1 — `structuredContent` is an opt-in MCP capability most
   servers never declare, and even when declared this harvest performs no runtime validation
   that it conforms. A property read on an `unknown` value is TS **18046** ("'x' is of type
   'unknown'"), which is intentionally NOT whitelisted (an unqualified unknown-property
   warning on every tool-result access would be noise, not signal). This class is
   structurally unreachable given the current harvest and has no row here.
