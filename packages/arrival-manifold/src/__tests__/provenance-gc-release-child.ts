// provenance-gc-release-child — the actual work `provenance-gc-release.test.ts` measures,
// run in a CHILD process (`--expose-gc`, via `npx tsx`) for the SAME reason
// `heap-canary-child.ts` is: the default vitest worker never gets `--expose-gc`, and an
// UNFORCED gc makes `process.memoryUsage().heapUsed` (and a `WeakRef` deref) noise, not
// signal — a coincidental collection could as easily hide a real leak as an absent one
// could fabricate one.
//
// Two phases, printed as ONE JSON object:
//
//   `direct`   — proves `EvalTrace.clear()` is the ACTUAL releaser of a provenance point's
//                retained value, via WeakRef exactness. Mints a point through the
//                manifold's REAL rosetta binding (`buildManifoldEnv` + a fake tool
//                returning an 8MB FLAT string), driving `execState({ ambient, scope, tap })`
//                directly — bypassing `manifold-tool.ts`'s `call()`, whose `finally` now
//                auto-clears the trace after every call (see that file's header), which
//                would make `clear()` untestable as a distinct, causal step. Then: drop
//                every OTHER reference (the session scope's `define` binding, the ambient,
//                our own locals) and prove the value SURVIVES on the trace alone (causality
//                leg #1 — the trace, not the scope, is what's retaining it), then `clear()`
//                and prove it's gone (causality leg #2).
//
//   `manifold` — the auto-clear invariant AT MAGNITUDE, exercised through the full
//                `createManifoldTool` + `tool.call()` path (where the auto-clear IS the
//                releasing act). A `WeakRef` taken DURING a call is impossible to reach
//                from outside `call()`'s own closure, so the externally-observable
//                equivalent is used instead: `trace.stats().entries === 0` after every one
//                of ten sequential 8MB-payload calls against ONE long-lived tool, plus a
//                flat heap slope across those calls — without the finally-clear this would
//                grow ~8MB/call (`FIXTURE_BYTES`), so a generously-below-that bound is a
//                real, non-coincidental gate.
//
// THE ROPE GOTCHA (cost a prior agent a false-negative harness): `"x".repeat(n)` builds a
// lazy V8 ConsString rope over the short source substring — it costs ~0 real heap no matter
// how large `n` claims to be, silently defanging a heap-retention probe. Fixtures here are
// built FLAT with the SAME technique `heap-canary-child.ts` already established:
// `Array.from({length}, () => row).join("")` forces one real, materialized allocation.
