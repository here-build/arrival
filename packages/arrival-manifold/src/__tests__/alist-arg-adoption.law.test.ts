// AN ALIST IN AN OBJECT-DECLARED SLOT IS A DICT — the contract selects the chart.
//
// Reported (real trajectory): a model wrote the ordinary Scheme spelling of a keyed argument —
//
//     (clinicaltrialsgov-mcp-server/clinicaltrials_list_studies :query (list (cons 'term "cancer")))
//
// and the tool received  [["term","cancer"]]  — a nested ARRAY, because a pair-spine projects to an
// array. The upstream refused it ("[[\"'term\", 'cancer']] is not of type 'object'"). The model then
// spent several rounds reasoning about quoting ("the single quote before term is being kept as part
// of the key"), tried string keys, and finally rediscovered our Clojure-style `{:term "cancer"}`
// literal by trial and error.
//
// Rounds spent relearning OUR notation, not doing the task. The medium made the model pay for our
// spelling — which is the whole thing this work exists to stop.
//
// THE FIX IS THE SAME LAW AS EVERYTHING ELSE: THE CONTRACT SELECTS THE CHART. The tool DECLARES
// `:query` is an object. An alist arriving in that slot is unambiguous — it is a caller spelling a
// dict the way Scheme spells one. So we read it as the slot says, and ONLY there.
//
// IT IS NOT A PROMOTION OF ALISTS (V's ruling: "we teach the system to treat an alist AS a dict —
// not to treat dicts as lists, not to promote alists; tolerance and affordance, not general
// design"). The outbound projection of a pair-spine is untouched: a list of pairs is still an array
// of arrays everywhere else, because everywhere else nothing has claimed otherwise.
