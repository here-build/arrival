// provenance-gc-release — proves `EvalTrace.clear()` is not merely a no-op bookkeeping
// call but the ACT that frees real heap: the empirically-confirmed within-task OOM driver
// (2026-07-14, see `manifold-tool.ts`'s `call()` `finally` and `provenance-arming.test.ts`)
// was a provenance point retaining a tool call's FULL boxed value forever. That fix is
// pinned at the STRUCTURE level (`trace.stats().entries === 0` after a call) by
// `provenance-arming.test.ts` already; this file pins it at the MEMORY level — a `WeakRef`
// taken on the exact retained object, proving it survives on the trace alone and dies once
// `clear()` runs, plus an actual `heapUsed` delta of the right magnitude.
//
// WHY A CHILD PROCESS: same reason as `heap-canary.test.ts` — the default vitest worker
// never gets `--expose-gc`, and an unforced GC makes both `process.memoryUsage().heapUsed`
// and a `WeakRef` deref noise, not signal. The measurement work
// (`provenance-gc-release-child.ts`) runs in a spawned `node --expose-gc` + tsx process,
// mirroring `heap-canary.test.ts`'s mechanism exactly (see that file's header for the full
// npx-vs-raw-node rationale).

 *  generational-GC promotion lag between the two forced-collection pairs. A REAL leak
