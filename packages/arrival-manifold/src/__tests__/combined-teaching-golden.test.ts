// COMBINED-TEACHING GOLDEN/CHARACTERIZATION TEST — pins block ORDERING and COEXISTENCE when
// several teaching mechanisms fire on the SAME call. Every mechanism is tested in ISOLATION
// elsewhere in this package, but `manifold-tool.ts`'s statement loop appends, in a FIXED order,
// statement-result blocks → futility `Note:` blocks → the type-hint trailing block → the
// attachment hidden-note → the attachment pass-through blocks. A refactor that re-homes these
// drains could reorder or silently drop a block class while every mechanism's OWN isolated test
// still passes — this is the one test that would catch that.
//
// One representative call fires FOUR mechanisms at once, through the REAL `buildManifoldServer` →
// `CallTool` path (never a hand-injected `createManifoldTool` call):
//   • a plain statement result                          (baseline — always present)
//   • a futility `Note:` (the 3rd distinct-arg call to a degraded tool, futility.ts)
//   • a type-hint trailing block (a genuine runtime type error, the real `createSpineLens`)
//   • BOTH attachment grades — one WITHIN quota (pass-through content block) and one HIDDEN past
//     quota (the trailing note + the stub-only text)
//
// Own this as a deliberate characterization LOCK: it should change only when block semantics
// intentionally change, never as a side effect of refactor plumbing.
//
// Every note-shaped producer (introduced-bindings, elision, futility, attachment) accumulates
// into `notes: string[]` and renders as exactly ONE trailing block, labelled
// `── environment notes ──`, AFTER every real block (statement results, type-hint, attachment
// pass-through content) — never interleaved.
