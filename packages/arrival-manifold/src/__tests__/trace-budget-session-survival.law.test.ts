// A RUNAWAY LOOP ENDS A PROGRAM. IT MUST NEVER END A SESSION.
//
// A real trajectory hit this: a char-walking `let loop` runaway legitimately tripped the trace
// cap, but every eval after it — arithmetic, `define`, string builtins, every MCP tool — kept
// failing for the rest of the session, with no recovery door back in.
//
// ─── THE CHAIN ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The tap is per-SESSION by design (one EvalTrace per world build — provenance must resolve across
// calls: a value minted in call 1, read back in call 3). But the cap was enforced against a counter
// that only reset in `clear()`. So:
//
//   1. A program legitimately exceeds the cap — `enter` THROWS mid-eval.
//   2. The eval unwinds, so entered invocations never `exit` — `#openCount` stays > 0.
//   3. The per-call GC calls `clear()`, which asserts `#openCount === 0` — it throws, and the throw
//      is SWALLOWED (that catch was written for abandoned timeout evals, which do eventually exit;
//      an unwound eval never will).
//   4. The counter is pinned at the ceiling forever. Every later `enter` throws on sight.
//
// A guard against a runaway loop must not be able to outlive the loop. `EvalTrace.beginRun()` re-arms
// the cap at the top of every run, which makes step 4 unreachable.
//
// These tests are the gate on that. The positive side proves the guard still guards; the negative
// side — the one that matters — proves it cannot take the session with it.

// A single 500k-step burn costs roughly 35s of real interpreter time, and every NEGATIVE case
// arms one in beforeEach. The law needs the production cap — a small cap would pass without
// exercising the real burn — so the price is the timeout, not the size.

 *  shape cannot exercise or gate the fix.
 *
 *  A char-walking `let loop` does NOT unwind cleanly — the throw leaves entered frames open, so
 *  `#openCount` stays > 0, `clear()`'s invariant throws, the runner swallows it, and the counter is
