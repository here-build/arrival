  const basePreamble = dedent`
    Call a bound tool with keyword arguments — any order, one value each:
      (github/search-issues :query "bug" :limit 5)
    Omit an optional parameter (marked with a trailing ?) by omitting its pair entirely.

    You are writing programs, not single calls. \`${ARG_NAME}\` takes a string or an
    array of statement strings, run as one program, with each top-level result
    returned as its own message. Compose instead of round-tripping:
      (users/get :id (:owner_id (repos/get :name "acme/app")))   ; nest — results are values
      (define orders (shop/list-orders :status "open"))          ; defines persist across calls
      (reduce + 0 (map (cut :total <>) orders))                  ; SRFI-1/13/26/28/43/95 subsets loaded (fold→reduce, any→some)

    Results print as Clojure-style literals — {:key value} dicts, [a b] vectors — and
    keywords are accessors: (:key obj). JSON tool output arrives parsed.
    An object-typed param takes that same literal: (tool :query {:term "cancer"}). A signature's
    \`-> shape\` declares its return shape. #| N not rendered, total TOTAL |# and …(+N chars)
    mark display-only sampling — the value stays INTACT: bind it and filter in-program.

    Serialized-TEXT output (CSV, JSON-in-string, Python repr, TOON) parses in-program:
    (detect-parse s) → records; (detect-envelope s) strips prose around JSON.

    The sandbox is pure except the bound tools — they are its only effects; no other
    IO, no mutation (set! and friends unbound), no call/cc. HOST EXTENSION: (display x)
    = identity + echo (no IO): returns x, and shows it in a #| |# note by the result.
    A per-call time budget
    stops runaway programs — so this REPL is a safe place to experiment: a failed
    statement costs nothing, later statements still run, everything that succeeded
    stays defined, and the error message is educational — it shows the correct form.
    Try, read the error, adjust.
