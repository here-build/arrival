// normalizer/observed-signature — the OBSERVED half of the response-normalizer's
// auto-present ruling (docs/response-normalizer.md §3.5): once the
// membrane auto-presents a tool's raw text as a parsed value (server.ts's
// `unwrapToolResult`, extended past the grandfathered single-block JSON.parse to the
// full `detectParse` family), the model should SEE the shape it is about to receive, not
// just receive it silently. This module is the per-tool "first contact" latch plus the
// pure string transform that folds an observed shape into a tool's existing catalog
// signature line — server.ts owns the wiring (tracker construction, the invoke-seam
// callback, the soft-refresh/listChanged trigger); this module owns no MCP/scheme/
// catalog concerns of its own.
//
// "Declared wins; observed only fills the default/absent case" (§2.1.1) is implemented
// with NO separate declared/observed bookkeeping: `amendSignatureText` only ever touches
// a signature line that does not already carry a `-> ` suffix — a declared outputSchema
// (tool-signature.ts's `renderOutputShape`) is the ONLY thing that ever puts one there
// before this module runs, so the guard IS the "declared wins" rule, expressed
// structurally rather than via a second source of truth that could drift from the
// catalog's own rendering.
//
// One-shot, never re-amended: a tool's FIRST successfully-parsed response latches its
// annotation permanently (never re-derived from a later, differently-shaped response) —
// this is deliberately NOT the full monotonically-widening ShapeLadder (ladder.ts,
// observe-only, not yet wired into any live path); it is the narrow "first contact" fact
// the auto-present ruling asks for, nothing more.

 *  A5 — "declared wins" was BACKWARDS. The only way this function is ever CALLED for a
 *  tool is via the text-block auto-present path (server.ts's `toBoundServer`, wired to
 *  `unwrapToolResult`'s `onAutoPresent` hook), which is reachable ONLY when
 *  `structuredContent` did NOT arrive this call — `unwrapToolResult`'s rule 2
 *  (`structuredContent` present) short-circuits and returns BEFORE rule 3's auto-present
 *  logic ever runs. So an observation that reaches here is, by construction, evidence
 *  that a DECLARED prior never materialized structurally this call: the catalog's
 *  `-> {declared shape}` line is not ground truth, and suppressing the real observation
 *  would let the catalog keep actively lying. The declared shape is therefore demoted to
 *  a parenthetical note rather than winning outright:
 *  `-> [observed] <shape> (declared: <declared shape>)`.
 *
 *  IDEMPOTENCY (still required — `applyObservedAmendments`, server.ts, re-runs this on
 *  EVERY soft refresh for every tool with a latched observation, not just newly-changed
 *  ones): the guard is "does `signatureText` already contain THIS EXACT `annotation`
 *  substring" rather than "does it already contain ` -> `" — the tracker's one-shot latch
 *  means `annotation` never changes for a given tool once recorded, so once spliced in,
 *  the same annotation string reappearing on a later call is the no-op signal. Without
 *  this, a declared+amended line would keep re-wrapping its own `(declared: …)` note on
 *  every soft refresh (the old " -> " guard could rely on structural presence alone
 *  because it always left ` -> ` newly-added lines untouched forever; this fix can't). */
