// normalizer/prelude — the scheme-facing prelude functions for the response-normalizer's
// inferred zone (docs/response-normalizer.md §3.5: "Parsers as first-class prelude
// functions ... pure, inline-usable on any value"). Every recognizer below the declared
// zone (A2 structuredContent, the grandfathered single-text-block JSON.parse) is
// MODEL-INVOKED, never automatic — the model suspects a tool's opaque text round-trips as
// CSV/TOON/Python-literal/JSON and calls the matching function itself, or reaches for
// `detect-parse` to try all of them in priority order. This module owns none of the
// recognizer logic (that's json.ts/csv.ts/toon.ts/python-literal.ts/detect.ts) — it is
// purely the string→ParseOutcome→(value | throw) lift those recognizers
// need to become scheme-callable, values-or-conditions functions.
//
// Design law carried over unchanged from every module this one wraps: strict-or-refuse.
// The wrapped recognizers never guess; a refusal here is not an exceptional condition to
// apologize for, it is the routine "wrong format, try another" outcome — which is exactly
// why it surfaces as a THROWN recoverable Error (errors-as-doors) rather than a `{ok:...}`
// record: a scheme caller wants the parsed value or a condition it can catch/branch on,
// never a boolean it has to remember to check (docs/response-normalizer.md §3.5's
// `(csv (tool/read-file :path "x.csv"))` reads only if a bad parse throws instead of
// silently handing back a refusal record the caller forgot to test).
//
// Binding shape: this module deliberately stops at plain named JS functions plus a
// descriptor array (`NORMALIZER_PRELUDE_SYMBOLS`) — see the file-level comment on that
// export for why. Nothing here imports
// `symbol`/`scheme-zod`/`EnvCapability`; wiring these into the assembled ambient (a
// `symbol.rosetta` call per descriptor, mirroring bind.ts's `validatorDef`) is the
// maintainer's integration step, not this module's.
