// normalizer/json — strict JSON and NDJSON recognizers for the response normalizer
// (docs/response-normalizer.md §3.5, §4.1, §4.2). Pure, zero-dependency, refusal-first:
// every function here either returns a confidently-typed value or refuses with a reason —
// never a best-effort guess. A refusal costs the caller nothing but a fallback path; a
// silent misparse costs the model a corrupted value it will trust. That asymmetry is the
// whole design law (strict-or-refuse), so ambiguous input always loses to REFUSED.
//
// This module holds the shared `ParseOutcome` contract every other normalizer recognizer
// (CSV/TSV, TOON, Python-literal, prose-envelope) imports.

/** Every recognizer in the normalizer returns this shape. `ok:true` carries the parsed
 *  value and a `format` tag (used by Stage D / the shape store, §8, to detect a format
 *  flip); `ok:false` carries a reason a caller can surface verbatim — never a thrown
 *  exception, since a refusal here is a routine "try the next recognizer" outcome, not
 *  an error. */

 * Scalar-yield (number/string/boolean/null) is REFUSED, not returned as-is. A text block

 * the number `123` while a sibling `"0123"` fails to parse (JSON numbers forbid leading
 * zeros) makes the outcome depend on digit content: two structurally-identical-looking
 * values, one silently retyped and one not. That's the exact corruption docs/response-
 * normalizer.md's audit (F3, NEW-6) calls out, and the reason strict-or-refuse exists —
 * a refused scalar costs a caller nothing (it already had the raw string); a coerced one
 * is silent type drift the model has no way to detect. */

 *  parseJsonStrict on the single line it actually is, or leaves the payload opaque) — a
 *  loose "most lines look like JSON" reading would silently drop or mistype the odd line
 *  instead of refusing the misclassification outright. A single object line is plain JSON,
 *  not a series; the ≥2 gate is what makes NDJSON's own claim ("this is a series of
 *  records") true rather than assumed from one sample.
